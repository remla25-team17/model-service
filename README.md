## [üì¶ Running with Docker](#-running-with-docker)
Docker allows you to package the entire application, including its dependencies, into a single container, making it easy to deploy consistently across different environments.

**Build the Docker image:**
The following command builds the Docker image locally:

```bash
docker build -t sentiment-service .
```

- `docker build`: This command tells Docker to create an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.

- `-t`: sentiment-service: The -t flag tags the image with the name sentiment-service so it's easier to reference later.

- `.`: The . specifies the build context, meaning Docker will use the current directory (which should contain your Dockerfile and app code) to build the image.


**Run the container:**
Once the image is built, you can run it with: 

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 sentiment-service
```
- `docker run`: This starts a new container from the sentiment-service image.

- `-p 8080:8080`: This maps port 8080 on your local machine (left side) to port 8080 inside the container (right side), making the API accessible at http://localhost:8080.

- `sentiment-service`: This specifies the image to run (the one you just built).

## [‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions & CI/CD](#Ô∏è-github-actions--cicd)

- **Build & Push:**
    - Every push to `main` or `develop/**` triggers GitHub Actions. 
    - The Docker image is built and pushed to:  `ghcr.io/remla25-team17/model-service:<version>`

- **GitHub App Authentication**

   For this project, we use a **GitHub App** to handle authentication in our CI/CD pipeline. Instead of relying only on GitHub‚Äôs default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which can sometimes have limited access (e.g. to trigger pre-release), the GitHub App gives us:

    - **Better security:** We can control exactly what the app is allowed to do (e.g. creating releases) without giving it more access than necessary.
    - **Reliable access:** The app works well even when we need to push images or create releases across different repositories or teams in the same organization.
    - **Clear traceability:** Every action is marked as being done by the GitHub App, so it's easy to see where changes come from.

- **Versioning:**
    - We use **GitVersion** to handle versioning automatically. GitVersion analyzes the repository‚Äôs Git history and branch structure to generate a **semantic version number** (SemVer) without needing manual tagging.
    - This ensures that every build and release is consistently versioned, reducing human error and making versioning fully traceable to Git history. Moreover, it is fully automatic: commit messages simply need to specify if it is a major/minor/patch(default) and `GitVersion.yml` will automatically calculate the release version.
    - For example:
        - Merges to `main` bump a stable version (e.g., `1.0.0`).
        - Builds from feature branches or pre-release branches (i.e., `develop`) are marked as **pre-releases** (e.g., `1.1.0-canary.5`), making it clear they're not production-ready. The counter at the end of the pre-release version signifies the current number of a pre-release.
    - This approach allows us to **automate releases** and keeps versioning fully aligned with Git flow practices.
